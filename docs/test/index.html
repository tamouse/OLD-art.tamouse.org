This is (so far) more of a novelty pen for me. I don't carry it, but I might pair it with a passport-sized Traveler at some point.\n* Pilot Prera, blue accent, Fine, inked with Noodler Red/Black. I think I understand why people love this pen so much. It might just be too light for me.\n* Noodler Creeper, flex nib. I like the flex on this a lot better than the Ahabs.\n* Noodler Ahabs, flex nibs, all. Mainly using for dorking around and pracice. These aren't in my EDC at all.\n* Faber-Castell Basic Carbon Black, Fine, inked with Diamine Prussian Blue. This one is in my EDC.\n* Lamy 2000, Fine, inked with Diamine Black Onyx. The fine nib on this one just doesn't feel right to me. It's an absolutely *gorgeous* pen, though, smooth, perfect weight, the skin feels so good to hold.\n* Edison Nuveau Premier, pearlized purple, Fine. This was my first higher-piced pen, and I have to admit I don't like it, don't use it. A bit disappointed.\n* Monteverde Intima Glacier Blue, currently sporting a Zebra G nib. This pen is easily my prettiest pen, and having a G nib I can easily carry is such a treet.\n* TWSBI 580, Broad. I don't share the love of the TWSBI 580 most people do, possibly because I have no love for broad tips. I thought I'd give it a go. I have both an EF and 1.1 stub in reserve, though, so I'll get around to trying those soon. Currently inked with Noodler Habanero. Will switch ink when I put in the other nibs.\n* Monteverde Jewelria trio, in Broad, Fine, and 1.1 Stub. I mainly bought these to try, along with the free bottle of ink in the Goulet special. I'm not super impressed, I guess.\n* Lamy Safari, Purple, Fine. Acquired as a set with the purple filofax. Meh.\n* Jinhao X750 pens. I bought these in the hope of switching in the Zebra G-nib. However, these came with Number 5 nibs instead of Number 6 so the swap won't happen. Uninked, unused.\n\n## Top Left, top down:\n\n* Monteverde Touch Screen Stylus Fountain Tool Pen. This was really just a goof purchase. I saw this pen and had to laugh, and so I bought it.\n* Sailor Fude de Mannon, 40 degree nib angle. I bought this because I was curious what sort of marks this would make. One of my hobbies is Sumi-e painting, and I have a few fude brushes. This is sorta reminiscient of them, but it's not something I'll probably use a lot.\n* Noodler Konrad Brush Pen. I have other brush pens similar to this, but none fillable. This doesn't see a lot of use, but some.\n\n## Top Right, going down:\n\n* Takikama holder with Zebra G nib\n* 3 Pelikan Carbon Fountain Desk Pens, Extra Fine. The first one of these was my Gateway pen, that started this all. Someone suggested it for urban sketching, cheap, refillable, nice nib. They are actually really great and goes with my sketching kit.
