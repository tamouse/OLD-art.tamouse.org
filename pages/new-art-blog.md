I've started a new version of this art blog.

## [{{ page.link.text }}]({{ page.link.href }}){:target="_blank"}

Having used Jekyll to much delight, I'm now finding it more
frustrating to have to deal with the getting all the images in the
right places, combining uploads, and so on, and have decided that
WordPress is really going to simplify this aspect of my blogging life.

I can concentrate on the art and less on the software.
