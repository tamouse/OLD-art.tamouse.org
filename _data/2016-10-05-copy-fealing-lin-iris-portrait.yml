      Paint wet into wet, mixing the 3 colours on the paper. Staying
      mostly to the yellow-red mixture to get skin tone, but with some
      blue to dull it down a bit. The blue is exceptionally powerful in
      this triad.

      While it was super wet, I also took out a lot of colour on the
      parts where I wanted the painting to be much lighter: the
      highlights of her face and shirt. This ended up working *really*
      well for me

      Concentrating on painting shapes of colour, rather than features.

      I wet the entire paper again, getting it pretty soppy. I again just
      started to put in the colour shapes I was seeing without trying to
      pay too much attention to any specific features such as eyes,
      cheek, nose, etc. Just what I was looking at.

      I absolutely love the really soft, feathering on the left shoulder,
      exactly the thing I was going for.

      I decided to leave behind the figure of Iris and start filling in
      the background.

      While the original had a more variagated and lighter background, I
      wanted to go full saturation with these pigments. Again, I'm
      working with the staining Winsor Newton pigments Winsor Red, Blue,
      and Yellow. Here I've also added Winsor Purple and Green.

      The paint here is still very, very wet as you can see.

      I applied a bit more colour in the background areas (not much!) and
      this is how the paint is drying out.

      This was taken much later, tonight, after everything had dried down
      completely.

      I'm liking this very much, actually, even thought the right hand
      side background is doing something a little weird because I got too
      much water in my brush. That will be quite fixable next session.

      I'm also liking the figure a lot here now, with the super contrast
      with the background really bringing her out, in spite of no details
      yet as far as features go.

      I'm super thrilled by how the neck shadow works, just perfectly how
      I wanted it to.

      The right side shoulder patch that I was worred about have a hard
      line for the shading is also not bothering me at all anymore.

      I'm rather liking how this is coming out.

      Again, ALL props me Ms. Lin -- this is her composition, her
      artistry, and I'm just (*badly*) copying her work. Thank you so
      much for the inspiration.

      Last week I left with the background on the right being a bit
      light, and many backwashes had happened (because I didn't control
      the water in the brush!). I went back over using a lot of Winsor
      Violet and Blue. I'm liking the background a lot.

      It was time to leave the large shapes of colour and start to work
      on the details, and bring out the actual portrait.

      The hat on Iris is interesting; she's wearing a baseball hat,
      backwards, and it's got a fair amount of texture to it. Plus there
      is a shadow on her forehead from the end of the adjustment strap.

      Her eyes are really an electric blue, and the Phthalo Blue lended
      itself directly to them. She's looking out of the picture to the
      viewer's right, but they will need some more work to give them the
      mischeivious glint that Ms. Lin so aptly captured.

      The purple bag strap was a fun feature to put in; I dragged in some
      really strong Winsor Violet, and then pull a bunch of it back out
      while it was still wet. I like the effect.

      I did a bit more on her shirt, but I was just trying to capture
      some of the wonderful feeling in the shades. I don't think I made
      it work.

      The finer details of the shirt's neckline and the purse strap went
      in using the Chromatic Black of French Ultramarine and Quin Burnt
      Orange.

      I also started painting in a lot of fine details using White
      Gouache: eye highlights, eyelashes, fine hair from her head, and
      trying to re-capture the very high key lights on her face.

      I don't think I've got this well in hand, but when viewed from
      across the room, I'm actually really pleased.

      I think I'm going to stop working on this one, and set it aside. I
      think I did a pretty good job with it, but I know I can do
      better. There are several things I'm really happy about, most
      importantly painting just what I actually was *seeing*, not what I
      was thinking about. So I was thinking "this patch of colour should
      be shaped like so, and shaded thus" *not* "now I am painting the
      cheek". I think it worked.
