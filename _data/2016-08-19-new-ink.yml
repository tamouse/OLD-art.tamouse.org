      I had been casting about for a really nice torquoise ink and
      happened across this one when an order invoice arrived from
      Goulet Pens with the personal note written in this ink, and I
      knew this was the one.

      I scribbled this out using one of the speedball nibs, C-4, which
      (I think) is 1.1mm, the same as the stub nibs I've been using on
      other pens.

      I really love this ink! It is exactly what I was looking for.

      In the dip nib, there was a lot of ink coming off it on the
      page. (I have to practice doing this more so I get a more even
      ink flow through the entire bit.)

      While not desirable normally, the ink took on a really cool look
      with more of the colour coming out.

      My usual experience when using the speedball nibs is that the
      ink runs out of them rather quickly, but in this case, the ink
      lasted a really long time. I was running out of words, and when
      I thought it was done, there was suddenly a bit more, and a bit
      more, and a bit more.

      The iroshizuku bottles are pure art themselves.
