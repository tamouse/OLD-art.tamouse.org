      The pen, disassembled, shows the discolouration on the barrel --
      it should be much lighter, more milky. Here it is quite a bit
      darker. Also, the greenish cast is from the ink leaking a bit
      into the cap after use. (I do not think it should be doing this,
      either.)

      The corrosion is quite obvious here. The paint that was on this
      piece (I do not know the technical name) was flaking off, making
      the unscrewing of the barrel really difficult. There was no ink
      leakage inside at all that I could see.

      From ink leaking into the cap after use. The ink is Iroshizuku Syo-Ro.

    caption: Bits of corrosion flaked off inside barrel

      You can see bits of the corrosion that fladed off inside the
      barrel.

      The green cast is from the cap leak.

      This shows the damage -- it extends even to the outside of the
      shaft. The threads are showing some of the damage as well.

      Flip side from the last shot, showing more damage.
