      The buildings were important to keep paint-free for as long as possible, while putting in the sky and middleground.

      I've gotten the sky how I want it, looking like a storm has just cleared and the sun is beaming in from behind the viewer.

      The original had a plowed field here, and I want to recreate the furrows. I painted in with some rich Quin Gold, and then scratched the furrows in. I'm a bit disappointed in the furrows, however, as they should be much more towards horizontal than they are, and they bow out too much.

      A bit of detail on the sky. I am pretty happy with it.

      Filled in more of the middle and foreground with the greens and yellows for the fields.

      Coming back to this today, I finally took off the masking fluid.

      Today's teacher, Edna, suggested I do something with the plowed field. At first I tried lifing the paint, but that proved futile as it was way down in the grooves I scratched. Instead I over laid it with a heavy layer of New Gamboge, which seems to have done the trick.

      I painted in some of the buildings stuff, not trying to be too precise or anything, just give the impression of weathering and age. I like how they came out.

      The final painting, I filled in some texture on the road, using dry brush.

      The paper had some really bad scratched on it, whether due to defects or me taking off the cover sheet -- this was the first sheet on the block. Edna gave me a good example of cropping the final and I think it worked out well.
