      My friends, Amy and Rick, have this absolutely gorgeous wedding
      photo over their mantle; I walked in one day and was just blown
      away by it. I asked Amy if I could paint it, she said "yes".

      I took the painting down to monochrome to help my study the
      values involved.

      I drew a few sketches to see how I could best make a painting
      out of their photograph. I came up with several.

      I wanted to really understand this painting. It's such a high
      key image with Amy's dress, all the sky, sand, the lighthouse,
      and all in direct sunlight.

      I usually start with the sky, and I like how this worked. It
      will get reworked later, but I was pretty happy with it like
      this, too.

      The original didn't really show any water, and the opposite side
      of the light house was houses. I decided to put the lighthouse
      out in the water, and have the water stretch out to the ocean.

      I then worked on Rick's suit, which was grey. I wanted his
      figure to be strong, since he's holding Amy up, and also to
      invoke the embrace they are in.

      The following week, I put in the sand as a base layer, added
      some vegetation, and put some shadows in Amy's dress. Working
      around I put in the long piece of driftwood to balance out the
      view.

      I was starting to work on more details in Rick's hair when I
      dropped some dark paint onto the sand. OOPS. I then did the
      wrong things to try and correct it.

      At least I got the couple's hair and skin in.

      Some other problems started to show up as well. The side of the
      lighthouse was bent, bulging towards the bottom. Amy completely
      disappears when you step away from the painting.

      I fixed the oops by turning it into another piece of driftwood.

      I fixed the side of the lighthouse by laying down a piece of
      scotch tape right alongside the lighthouse where I wanted the
      wall to run and sealing the left edge of it with my
      thumbnail. Then just painted over the tape and paper with the
      dark grey, and pulled the pigment away from the edge to soften
      it and create the shadow. Lifting the tape I was so happy to
      find the edge perfectly straight. I let out a "YIPPEE!!" and the
      class cheered. (Okay, they laughed.)

      For the final step, I went back to the sky to fill in more blue
      to make Amy reappear and be fully part of the painting. I had to
      work on this a bit to make sure it didn't look too much like an
      addition, and to make sure it didn't just appear as a special
      outline of her dress.

      I'm really happy with this one. I hope they like it.
