<h1>Announcement</h1>

<p>
  I am in the process of moving this site/blog from a Jekyll-based
  blog to a WordPress-based blog. You can see the new site
  at <a href="http://art.pontiki.io">art.pontiki.io</a> now while I am
  transferring images and posts. I'm hoping to have all links lined up
  so that by the end of the process, everything will be back in place.
  Cheers!
</p>
